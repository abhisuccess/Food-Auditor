          <h2>History of Food Nutrition</h2>
          <p>
            The history of food nutrition and related research dates back to ancient civilizations, but formal scientific studies began in the 18th and 19th centuries. Early food practices were based on trial and error, with many cultures identifying specific foods for health benefits. In the 18th century, scientists like Antoine Lavoisier advanced understanding by studying metabolism and how the body uses energy from food.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 19th century, the discovery of vitamins marked a major turning point. Researchers like Casimir Funk identified vitamins as essential nutrients for health, and in the early 20th century, researchers started to link specific deficiencies to diseases such as scurvy, rickets, and beriberi.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mid-20th century saw the emergence of more structured research, with the development of nutrition science as an academic discipline. The establishment of major organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) promoted global initiatives to improve nutrition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, nutrition research continues to evolve, with ongoing studies focusing on the role of nutrients in chronic diseases, the microbiome, and personalized nutrition, reflecting the growing understanding that diet plays a crucial role in both preventing and managing health conditions.
